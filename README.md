# NUI

A Vue.js 3.0 UI library.

## Why is it called NUI

N means New, Nature, and more means NENU.

+ New: NUI takes a new approach to design and puts the power of UI design back into the hands of downstream developers and even users.
+ Nature: The inspiration and color scheme of Nui comes from natural colors, and the interactive logic is as close to Nature as possible.
+ NENU: To my Alma mater, Northeast Normal University.
